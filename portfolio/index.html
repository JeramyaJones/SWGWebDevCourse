		<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
		<p>My name is Nathaniel, I am 27 years old and still in school. I have a 3 year old son William and a wife named Katya. I live out in Lavon Texas right next to lake Lavon.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
		<p>Prior to working in software I was in the resturant managment bussiness. I am now a software QA analyst. I have written many automated scripts in the groovy language using a tool called Katalon.</p>
		<p>I am learning more about software testing and the busniess of developing daily. I hope to one day be a developer myself.</p>
		<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
		<p>I enjoy going to the lake with my son and wife. I also skateboard frequently. I am not any good but I have fun doing it. :P </p>
		<p>I also spend alot of my time hanging out with my grandparents or other family memebers. They will not be around forever and I want to make sure my son has a chance to get to know them.</p>

					<p>Prior to working in software I was in the restaurant management business. <strong>I am now a software QA analyst.</strong> I have written many automated scripts in the groovy language using a tool called Katalon.</p>
					<p>I am learning more about software testing and the business of developing daily. <strong>I hope to one day be a developer myself.</strong></p>

					<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
					<img src="Images\Skatboard.jpg" alt="Picture of skateboard"/>
					<p><span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">I enjoy going to the lake with my son and wife. I skateboard frequently. I am not any good but I have fun doing it. :P </span></p>
					<p>I spend a lot of my time hanging out with my grandparents or other family members. They will not be around forever and I want to make sure my son has a chance to get to know them.</p>
